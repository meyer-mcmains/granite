# Michael Bentley
>
> The decision to write this project in C\# worried me greatly when we
> first started because I had never used the language before and it seemed
> that everyone else in the group was well versed in the language. For
> the first few meetings I felt irrelevant as a team member until I
> realized a crucial niche that was underserved on our team. As a whole
> our team’s knowledge of SQL and database structure was lacking, but those are both things at which I feel I am strong in.
> Immediately I knew what I could bring to the table.
>
> From that point on, I handled the creation and updates of our
> databases. In addition, whenever an SQL statement was needed for a
> particular functionality, the developers would normally let me know
> about it and I would get back to them as soon as possible. As the
> database architect, I had to take part in a great deal of
> troubleshooting when new code was written to ensure that the data
> being passed back and forth was correct. I tried my best to include as
> much database documentation on Slack as possible. I kept a text file
> up to date with the field names and data types found in each table.
>
> As the weakest C\# programmer on the team, I found other ways to
> contribute. For instance, I took on a good amount of the paperwork in
> the early sprints. I also assessed the user stories and determined the
> goals that needed to be achieved for the week. Normally at the end of
> class I would either try to delegate tasks or attempt to find a time that we could all meet up and
> work on the project together.
>
> I am proud of my team and I would be pleased to work with them again
> in the future. Our skillsets and personalities made us a very cohesive
> group. We were able to have a good time, but we also knew when it came
> time to crack down and get things done.

# Shane Dering
>
> I was the scrum master for our team. My main duties throughout the
> project were making sure everyone was working well together and that scrum was
> working for us and not against us. I also worked on the various design
> documents throughout the sprints; user stories, test cases, use cases
> and sequence diagrams.
>
> Our team worked well with each other. Slack was a great tool that we
> used to update everyone on the status of our individual tasks and user
> stories. Team members often posted to Slack when they ran into
> difficulties or had questions. The standup meetings conducted twice a
> week were very beneficial to our productivity as a team. It was during
> these meetings that we could address larger problems that could not be
> easily solved through Slack or over text. In addition, the stand up meetings provided a solid time for us to discuss the status of the
> project as a whole, assign user stories, and grow as a team. We
> implemented pair programming sessions later on in the project’s
> development. This agile method proved effective for us since many team
> members were working on things outside of their usual spectrum of
> expertise.
>
> Many of the issues that arose during this semester involved the
> database in some manner. Interfacing the database with the bulk of our C\# code is something
> that I and other members of the team are inexperienced with. This is where the pair programming meetups
> really helped. Since Michael and Brandon are much more fluent with
> database creation, management and integration, their hands on guidance
> alleviated many of the problems that we ran into. I realized that
> there is a potential pitfall with pair programming; grouping up when
> it is not vital can cause a decrease in productivity, since your development speed is essentially cut in half. We struggled with this
> at the beginning, meeting up too frequently. We chose to limit our
> pair programming sessions to times when we deemed it absolutely
> necessary, and in those circumstances it worked well.
>
> Overall, the lines of communication between or team were strong, and
> they strengthened as the project developed. We used U-Track for
> setting up the storyboards, manage the backlogs and assign user
> stories. Personally, I believe that the Zenhub extension would have
> been easier for our team to use. Zenhub roughly performs the same duties that U-Track does, but it is
> more streamlined and built directly into Github once downloaded. This
> would things easier for the team since it would mean one less channel
> to constantly check and update.

# Trystan Humann
>
> I was the C\# specialist, Adobe Photoshop expert, and one of the developers for our team. Some of my responsibilities on the project
> included developing an intuitive approach to the user interface,
> creating that user interface, and connecting that user interface to the database. I also
> tested the software and created custom graphics for the main menu, so
> that the user would find it error free and easier to navigate.
>
> The task I found most success in was creating an easy and natural way
> for the user to navigate the program. Some other successes I had when
> working on the project came from pair programming with Brandon Jones. Brandon helped me correct mistakes before testing,
> showed me interesting ways to solve a problem, and helped influence
> the back end design of the program by suggesting what approach would
> be easiest to implement. Brandon also recognized I had little
> experience with implementing the way the database communicated with
> the user interface, so he stepped in and pointed me in the right
> direction. Brandon's help with database to user interface
> communication eventually led to a successful project.
>
> The task I had the most trouble with was getting the database to
> communicate to the user interface. I had little experience with database and found myself
> consistently confused when I tried to use new ways to allow the
> database to communicate with the user interface and program. Another
> thing that could have been an issue, but worked out since each member
> of the team has a different development background, was pair programming.
> Pair programming can be a loss of productivity if not correctly used,
> but Brandon and Michael's knowledge on database was invaluable.
> Without pair programming, this project would have been much more
> difficult to implement.

# Tyler Huskins
>
> My main duties throughout the project was programming and designing
> the windows for the project. One of the things I was successful at was
> creating and adding to the window forms. Some of the things I had the
> most difficulties with the code to interact with the database and
> uploading to GitHub.
>
> Creating and using the windows forms was very easy for me. I have used
> windows forms in many of my classes, so they were nothing new to me. I
> helped to manipulate the windows forms so that they could pass user and student information
> between them. This way the forms could work off of the same user and
> student classes without asking for the user or student information
> over and over. There are some things I wish I could fix in my windows
> form code, but overall I feel proud of it.
>
> The one thing that gave me trouble with this project was the database
> code. I have never worked on a C\# program that interfaced with a
> database before. It was odd to not have the information in my program
> whenever I want it, like with hard-coded or user given variables.
> Another part of database interfacing that gave me trouble was the SQL code. I have not thought
> about SQL since my sophomore year and it showed.
>
> Another thing that I struggled with was uploading code to GitHub. I
> have never used or worked with GitHub before. I feel it was partly
> because I did not ask my teammates if I was uploading my code right. I
> never heard anything bad about my uploads until towards the end when
> it was becoming a problem. One thing that could have helped was the
> Visual Studio plug-in. I did not have the plug-in that integrated GitHub into Visual Studio. Looking
> back now I should have gotten that plug-in and saved myself and my
> teammates quite a bit of work.

# Brandon Jones
>
> My main duties throughout the project were developing the app and
> handling the database along with Michael. As only the two of us had significant
> experience with databases those tasks fell to us. I think our greatest strength in
> this project has been our ability to work well as a team without everyone
> stepping on other’s toes to get work done.
>
> My greatest successes in this project were really in conjunction with
> another teammate so it would be unfair to call them my successes.
> Early on I made some changes to the database schema that Michael had
> prepared though we ended up changing that somewhat later. I also
> developed the queries for the analytics along with Michael, and helped
> to troubleshoot some issues and guide some of the development with the
> other guys where needed.
>
> The biggest issue I faced with this project wasn’t related to the
> project at all but unfortunately had a big impact on my overall
> contribution to the project during the middle portion of the semester.
> Around that time the engine in my car gave out, and threw my schedule
> into chaos as it had to be worked around that of others. This lead to
> me only being able to spend a short while after class with the group,
> and I rarely had any time at home to make meaningful progress. After several
> weeks, I managed to procure a car and was able to truly rejoin the group effort as the project was
> wrapping up.

# Meyer McMains
>
> My duties through the project were programming and managing the GitHub,
> however I also performed other miscellaneous tasks such as creating the splash
> screen image. There were several things during the project that I was quite
> successful doing. This includes database operations and manipulating windows
> forms. While these things went well I had difficulties with managing the GitHub.
>
> Implementing the database connectivity was considerably new to me. I
> have interacted with databases before, but had never been challenged with connecting and
> manipulating a database through a separate language. Initially, setting up simple interactions with
> the database was difficult, but after looking through examples and implementing the code myself, I began to
> understand how to manipulate the database pertaining to the situation
> whether it was getting data from the tables or updating tables with
> new data. Using windows forms went well throughout the project. I have
> used forms in the past but not on the same scale. Despite this our
> implementation of forms was consistent. The complexity of the forms
> for this project was more than I was used to, but I was up to the
> challenge.
>
> Managing the GitHub was the bane of my existence during the project. I
> had previously have some exposure with GitHub and have a few
> projects hosted beforehand. Those projects were small scale and have
> very few branches. The main problems I had were related to merging
> branches. After figuring out the workflow for merging through Visual
> Studio I figured I was all set to continue managing branches for the
> rest of the project. I was wrong. Many of the problems I encountered
> was due to errors with branches that my teammates had uploaded. This
> was largely due to how they were pulling the Master branch and
> uploading their new branch. There were files and folders in branches
> that should not have been there. Even after removing unneeded files,
> merging was not always easy. Some of this was due to errors in Visual
> Studio and other problems were simply human error. I would suggest
> that teams make sure everyone on the team knows how to properly create
> and merge branches.

> ***Successes:***
>
> Our biggest strength was our ability to work together. There was not a
> single challenge that we faced that we did not face as a group. During
> our group sessions, anytime someone was struggling, someone else would
> stop what they were doing to help out. It also helped that our
> skillsets were so diversified. We had a great group of diligent C\#
> programmers as well as skilled SQL people. Together there wasn’t a
> problem that couldn’t be solved with a little bit of effort. It also
> helped that everyone was able to contribute and it wasn’t a small
> demographic pulling the weight for everyone. When it was time to work,
> every member of the team was participating.
>
> ***Challenges:***
>
> Without a doubt, GitHub was our greatest challenge. Our method of “all
> or nothing” pushes and creating a new branch for each update was sloppy, but rather than
> attempting to educate ourselves, we just pressed on with our
> development. If this project would have been bigger, then perhaps more
> time would have been spent on understanding Git, but as it stood, time
> could be better spent on development.
>
> Creating a database enabled program was also something that many
> members of the team had never experienced before and therefore getting
> database connectivity was an early challenge. Even once the connection
> was established, retrieving and utilizing the data from the database
> was difficult. Luckily after a few sprints, the process of getting the
> SQL, retrieving the data and utilizing it was so ingrained in our team
> that certain user stories that would have been next to impossible for
> our team at the beginning were some of the easiest by the end.
>
> ***Moving Forward:***
>
> Luckily for the GOAT team, we were all able to get permits into Dr.
> Barrett’s Software Engineering II class for next semester, so we are
> already making plans for our next project. While we do not know what
> that will entail, we do know that through this project we have become
> well equipped for whatever our next challenge may be.
>
> One thing that we would like to try is utilizing Zenhub rather than
> YouTrack as Shane believes that it is more streamlined and has a
> higher chance of being utilized effectively by the team. Also with our
> next project we are looking to handle GitHub more efficiently.
>
> We are definitely going to continue the group programming sessions as
> that was when the group was the most productive. We get to work
> together as a group, get multiple eyes on every bug, and most importantly, we get to go get Knight’s Pizza afterward.
